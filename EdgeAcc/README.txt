edge_accuracy.py:
Computes the accuracy of the output graphs of either tracker to the manually-labeled ground-truth graph. ".p" files are pickle files for the ground-truth graphs. Other files contain required classes to load pickle files.

Code execution for Accuracy measurement:
1. Move the save.p pickle file for tracker output into the folder EdgeAcc.
2. Modify the path to save.p and ground truth being tested in lines 8 and 9 of edge_accuracy.py, and run code to view accuracy measures.
