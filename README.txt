ESE FINAL PROJECT: BIOLOGICAL CELL TRACKING
Team Members: David Hernandez and Nivedha Sivakumar

We have implemented 2 biological cell trackers for this project: one with Kalman filter and Hungarian assignment, another with Viterbi algorithm and Kalman filter.

Submission folder structure:
├── KalmanHungarianCode
├── KalmanFilterVideos
├── Viterbi+KF_Code
├── Viterbi+KF_Videos
└── EdgeAcc

Submission folder contents:
1. KalmanHungarianCode: Folder containing the first cell tracker implementation, and a README with code execution instructions.
2. KalmanFilterVideos: Folder contains video segments for good and bad examples of tracker. A README document is present in folder detailing the noteworthy tracks.
3. Viterbi+KF_Code: Folder containing the second cell tracker implementation, and a README with code execution instructions.
4. Viterbi+KF_Videos: Folder contains video segments for good and bad examples of tracker. A README document is present in folder detailing the noteworthy tracks.
5. EdgeAcc: Code used to evaluate accuracy of track outputs, including manually-labeled ground-truth graph data. Includes README
